# BEACONs Movement Apps

## Available apps

### Movement Mapper

The Movement Mapper app is intended to assist users with animal movement data (e.g., GPS relocations) to define seasonal migration periods for caribou (and other ungulate species). Currently, the app works best for defining segments where rapid movements occurs, for example during spring and fall migration periods.

### Movement Explorer

The Movement Explorer app is intended to be used as part of a workflow for exploring movement data. Specifically, the app can help users to: i) visualize animal locations and trajectories, ii) define seasonal and migration periods, iii) estimate annual and seasonal ranges, and iv) identify seasonal movement corridors (paths).

Note: We recommend using the Movement Mapper rather than the Movement Explorer app if the main purpose is to define migration periods.
