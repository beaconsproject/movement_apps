# BEACONs Movement Mapper

October 7, 2025

The Movement Mapper app is intended to assist users with animal movement data (e.g., GPS relocations) to define seasonal migration periods for caribou (and other ungulate species). Currently, the app works best for defining segments where rapid movements occurs, for example during spring and fall migration periods.
